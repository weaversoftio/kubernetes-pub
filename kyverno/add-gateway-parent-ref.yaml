      Automatically adds parentRefs to samsung-gateway-fabric Gateway
      for HTTPRoute resources that don't have one specified.
      Works with NGINX Gateway Fabric (Gateway API).
      
      This is a safety policy that ensures all HTTPRoutes are connected
      to the Gateway, even if created manually or by other tools.
